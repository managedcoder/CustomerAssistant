# Conversational Touchpoint Accelerator
## Overview
Enterprise touchpoints are channels that connect people to organizations. These
touchpoints could be a website, mobile app, social media, personal assistants, 
or a call center.  Conversation is the most natural and effective means for 
people to communicate in these touchpoints. This accelerator is a blueprint for
transforming any enterprise touchpoint into a balanced conversational experience
with the right blend of Conversational AI and human agent interaction, when that's
needed.  

Examples of touchpoint transformations are:
* Front-end a call center with a bot to deflect and reduce traffic to human agents
* Add an enterprise assistant bot to a webpage that can escalate to an agent when needed
* Add a conversational UI to the existing UX of a mobile application (i.e., make mobile app conversational!)

Patterns of Transformation:
* Interject bot between user and agent as in the call center transformation
* Interject agent into bot as in enterprise assistant bot scenario
* Interject conversation into mobile apps where no prior conversational experience existed
<pre><code><b>NOTE:</b> This project is a work in progress and this overview is 
aspirational currently and we'll be adding a roadmap of features soon to make it 
easier to understand the current and future capabilities of this accelerator.</code></pre>
## Solution Elements

##### Figure 1: Solution Elements
Figure 1 shows the various solution elements of the touchpoint accelerator which 
will extend the standard Bot Framework virtual assistant pattern in the following ways:
### Agent Hub
Recipe for message-based live chat support through integration with solutions like Dynamics
365 Omnichannel for Customer Service, LivePerson Customer Care, ServiceNow, Azure
Communication Services, and Teams.

The agent hub solution element also include a recipe for stand-alone call center support
or integration with existing call center solutions.

This agent hub element provides support for informal, low cost scenarios like an internal 
"help desks" and more sophisticated and capable solutions targeting an enterprise call
center.
### Customer Service
A "plug-in" approach for the integration of 1st and 3rd party customer service solutions.  The
initial focus will be on supporting Dynamics 365 Customer Service.
### Client Experiences
Extends the standard Bot Service client experiences to include [Conversational Applications](http://aka.ms/capps) 
which provide conversationally-immersive desktop and mobile client experiences.
### DevOps
Recipe for employing DevOps to develop and operate the Customer Assistant solution.
### Analytics
Extends the standard Bot Framework analytics to include call center specific analytics that will 
provide customer service insight across every conversational touchpoint in an enterprise.
### iPaaS
